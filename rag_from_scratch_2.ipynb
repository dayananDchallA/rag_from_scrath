Planning: The agent utilizes techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts to decompose complex tasks into smaller subgoals. This planning process helps the agent understand the steps involved in a task and plan ahead for efficient problem-solving.\\n\\n2. Subgoal Decomposition: By breaking down tasks into manageable subgoals, the agent can approach problem-solving in a step-by-step manner. This allows for a structured approach to handling complex tasks and ensures that the agent can make progress towards achieving its goals.\\n\\n3. Reflection and Refinement: Autonomous agents engage in self-criticism and self-reflection to learn from past actions, refine their approach, and improve the quality of their final results. This iterative process of reflection and refinement enables the agent to adapt and grow over time.\\n\\n4. External Classical Planner (LLM+P approach): In some cases, an external classical planner is used for long-horizon planning. LLM translates the problem into a planning domain language, requests a classical planner to generate a plan, and then translates the plan back into natural language. This interaction with an external planner enhances the agent's ability to plan for long-term goals.\\n\\n5. Self-Reflection Integration (ReAct): Systems like ReAct integrate reasoning and acting within LLM, expanding the action space to include task-specific actions and language prompts. This integration allows LLM to interact with the environment, generate reasoning traces in natural language, and facilitate self-improvement through iterative learning. \\n\\nOverall, the interaction between these components enables the autonomous agent to effectively plan, decompose tasks, reflect on past actions, engage with external planners when needed, and continuously improve its performance through self-reflection and learning.\""

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.'),\n",

This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:'),\n",

Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools.
